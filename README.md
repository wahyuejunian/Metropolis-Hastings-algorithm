# Metropolis-Hastings-algorithm

Metropolis–Hastings algorithm is a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method for obtaining a sequence of random samples from a probability distribution from which direct sampling is difficult. Metropolis–Hastings and other MCMC algorithms are generally used for sampling from multi-dimensional distributions, especially when the number of dimensions is high (Wikipedia).

This code is an example of applying Metropolis–Hastings algorithm to determine the epicenter of an earthquake
